# SEPTA Discord Bot

## Project Abstract

This project delivers a Discord bot that provides real-time SEPTA Regional Rail information to commuters. The bot integrates with SEPTA’s public APIs to display live train statuses, delays, station arrivals, outage alerts, and next-train predictions. Users can also subscribe to specific train lines and automatically receive notifications about delays or service interruptions. The goal is to create a simple, accessible, and community-friendly tool for anyone who uses SEPTA transit.

## High Level Requirement

The SEPTA Discord Bot must:

- Allow users to request real-time information using slash commands.
- Provide regional rail line status, station arrivals, and next train times.
- Handle user subscriptions and send automated delay/outage alerts.
- Normalize and validate station names for user-friendly interaction.
- Operate asynchronously to support multiple users simultaneously.
- Run reliably on Discord 24/7 with minimal manual intervention.

## Conceptual Design

- **Platform:** Discord  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** discord.py  
- **Architecture:**  
  - API Integration Layer (fetches SEPTA data via aiohttp)  
  - Command Handlers (slash commands such as `/next_train`, `/check_line_status`)  
  - Subscription System  
  - Background Task Cog  

The bot runs on an asynchronous event loop, enabling fast API calls and real-time interactions with multiple users.

## Background

SEPTA provides public real-time transit data through its APIs, but they are not always easy for riders—especially students—to navigate quickly. Existing tools like TrainView and NextToArrive work, but require manual refreshing and provide inconsistent formatting.

Discord provides an ideal platform for aggregating SEPTA information simply and reliably.
